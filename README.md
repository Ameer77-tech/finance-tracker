# 🧠 How It Works<br>
→ Data is stored as an array of transaction objects in localStorage.<br>
→ Balance and totals are calculated dynamically from stored data.<br>
→ Framer Motion provides animations on adding, deleting, and editing transactions.<br>
→ Resetting clears balance data but keeps history intact unless explicitly deleted.<br><br>
